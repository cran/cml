Description: Finds a low-dimensional embedding of high-dimensional data, conditioning on available manifold information. The current version supports conditional MDS (based on either conditional SMACOF in Bui (2021) <arXiv:2111.13646> or closed-form solution in Bui (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.patrec.2022.11.007>) and conditional ISOMAP in Bui (2021) <arXiv:2111.13646>.
